## The full version

### Preamble

This document defines the Code of Conduct (from now on called: CoC) of the
international PHP Facebook Group (from now on called: the group) and its environments.
You **accept** the given rules of this CoC **when joining** our group **or participating**
on our repositories. You **must** follow this CoC, **any violation** results in
the temporary or permanent removal of your membership(s). This CoC counts for
everyone, administrators and regular members. The content of this CoC is not
open for discussion.

The following rules are **mandatory** to participate in group and all repositories:

### Content localization

Anything published on the timeline of the group must be in **English**. Members
of the group are located all over the world. The language of the group has been
standardized to **English** to guarantee painless communication. Attached shares
localized into other languages will be removed without further notice. Posted
content that is localized in other languages and that does not count as a regular
Facebook share will be removed and topic author will be temporary removed from
the group.

Commits sent to our repositories must be localized in **English**. Commits that
are not localized in English will be rejected. Issues must be localized in
**English**. Issues that are not localized in English will be closed without any
investigation.

### Content quality

Shares and posts to the timeline **must have a regular level of quality**.
Questions **must be researched** before being posted. The group acts as a group
to help on specific problems, not to read out documentations or querying the web
for you. You must **avoid posting large code snippets** pasted on the timeline
of the group. We recommend to serve source code in any case as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com)
to grant the best possible readability. Large source codes posted on the timeline
are difficult to read, because of the limited space on Facebook. Topics with
large source codes as its content will be removed from the timeline of the group.
Comments with large source codes as its content will be removed from the content
stream. Repeated post of large source codes are punished with a permanent
removal of the membership(s).

Commits sent to our repositories must be fully researched and localized into
English. There is no place for low quality content. Low quality content include
topics with only code *without a proper description of the problem*, unclear
photos of screens that are hard to read and job opportunity shares that don't
have a proper introduction.

### Forbidden content

It is not allowed to post content that does not cover PHP and web-centric
development. Any violation of this rule will result in permanent removal of the
membership. Content that violates the Facebook community rules will be forwarded
to the Facebook staff.

**Job opportunities** must be PHP related and should be done in a peaceful period.
Do not post your stuff every day or every hour. Our group aims to discussions and
should not act as a job feed. Any other opportunities will be removed.

Humor and sarcasm are not encouraged because they can have different points of
reference among users.

Personal data (emails, phone numbers, WhatsApp numbers, Skype identities or
addresses in general) are explicitly not allowed in the group and will end
**in any case** with a permanent removal of your membership(s).

**Hijacking topics** is not allowed. This either includes offtopic advertisements
in comments or commenting in a way that should be done by starting a new
conversation.

Exploits and hacks will be deleted and will end with a permanent removal of your
membership(s).

Committing any kind of the described forbidden content to our repository will be
rejected and your behavior will be alerted to the GitHub staff.

Security issues are examined and treated accordingly to the severity of the
situation. If the issue is severe the topic is removed from the public discussion
to prevent further possible damage. Project owners are notified about it and are
given time to fix it.

### Social behavior

**You have to act social**. There is no place for harassments, bulling or political
content that does not cover web development topics. You should never compromise
or harm other members. Violating this rule will result in a permanent removal of
the membership(s).

**Discrimination is not acceptable**. Discrimination on the basis of race, gender,
sexual orientation, gender identity, age, nationality, religion, technology and
any other arbitrary exclusion of a group of people is unwelcome. The use of
sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances is not
acceptable.

**You have to act peaceful**. There is no place for terrorism, recruitment shares
and social honeypots. We actively track group content and will forward such
content directly to Facebook and **international authorities**. Our main duty is
to **protect our members**.
